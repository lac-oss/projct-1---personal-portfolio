          <h2>Brief working experience</h2>
          <p>I have started my working experience in a multicultural company, 3 years back, working as receptionist for a company that offers serviced apartaments for short term rentals. I have been happy to work with the team and toghether to improve the level of customer service offered and to increase the score level in the companie's online presence.</p>
          <p>6 months later, I have joined a start up company, working as customer service agent in the same business area. It's been an amazing experience were I had the chance to offer support to the customers through chat, email, zendesk and phone but also to gain more experience in customer service and to develop my skills.</p>
          <p>Further to this experience, two years ago, I have joined the residential proprieties environment working as concierge in high end proprties in central London and I have developed my customer service skills even more.</p>
